<h2>My Planing Step</h2>

<h3>1. List All requirement and draw a Wireframe</h3>
Let's thingking about what user want throught User Stories 

<h3> 1.1 User Stories </h3>

<ul>
  <li>As a User I want to have an account for my website</li>
  <li>As a User I want my website to have two main page such as homw page and userdetail page or more</li>
  <li>As a User I want to have a product page to select and view product detail.</li>
  <li>As a User I want my product page able to buy product.</li>>
</ul>

<h3>1.2 Wireframe </h3>
  We sperate in two part for wire frame
  
  Start with Frontend wire frame, For login page, Homw Page, User detail Page. </p>

<h2>2. Make a List of technical difficulties and study all of them</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Django template</li>
  <li>Django</li>
  <li>git comman</li>
  <li>html, css,  java script</li>
  <li>psql</li>
  <li>Three.js</li>
  <li>Rest Frame work</li>
  <li>Foudation Frame work</li>
</ul>


## 3. Make a simple step plan

Spilt to three part 'Frontend' by useing react, 'database' in bit.io and, 'sequelize' in backend.


### Front Django web template
<ol>
  <li>Home page
  <ul>
    <li>Create Home page by template.</li>
    <li>Hava link with urls.py and view.py .</li>
    <li>The page have ability to send Post an delete data page to database.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
    
  <li>Login page
  <ul>
    <li>The page have ability to send Post data page to database.</li>
    <li>Have authentication</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
  


### Backend database
<ul>
  <li>Create Model for Table.</li>
  <li>Create view for make CRUD method for user</li>
  <li>Create Urls 
  <li>Make a local data base in psql to test.</li>
  <li>make relation to database as er diagram.</li>
  <li>create a data in bit.io.</li>
  <li>connect data base in bit.io to real react page.</li>
</ul>

**User Process**
<ul>
  <li>Do an authen.</li>
</ul>


<h3>What would you do differently?</h3>

<p>The most interesting thing I decise to pay attion to is dev too : "Foundation Framework". It is an React UI library antd that contains a set of high quality components and demos for building rich, interactive user interfaces.

<h3>What did you learn?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Time management</li>
  <li>New tool</li>
  <li>Full stack django</li>
<ul>
